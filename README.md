# AsUBus iOS Source

AsUBus was an iOS application designed to assist riders of the AppalCART transit system in Boone, NC. At the time of the project's development the only way to view bus schedules was through online .pdfs, which was incredibly clunky on mobile devices. AsUBus was designed as a streamlined solution for riding the bus system through a minimal and easy to use interface which displayed routes and scheduled times per stop for users. At the peak usage AsUBus had over 8,500 users.

## Features

- Schedule data, all (then) current routes and stop data
- Live stop countdowns, on a stop's detail page the app will display a countdown to the next scheduled arrival
- Schedule view, lists of the official schedules for each route per season
- Favorites, ability to flag stops as favorites for quick access from main menu
- Ad integration, ads pulled from a web sever, never actually used besides for sending out news updates
- Twitter integration, navigation from the main menu directly to the AppalCART twitter (where they posted closures)
- Reports, users could email reports (missing/full busses, bad drivers, etc.) from a clicker menu feature that let them generate parseable report data (sent to an empty email inbox after AppalCART threatened to arrest me for sending them the report data...)

## Project Termination

Due to legal and economic pressuring from both AppalCART and App State I shut this project down in the Fall of 2014. I originally created this app during the summer of 2012 and launched it in September. From then on I maintained the app, and released constant updates, always keeping the app free for users. In the Fall of 2014 AppalCART announced that they were purchasing an expensive alternative to AsUBus which would provide GPS location updates for the busses. Of course I could not compete with live GPS data and was forced to end my involvement in the project.
